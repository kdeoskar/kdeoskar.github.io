<!-- # Who am I? -->
My name is Keshav. I'm an undergrad studying Engineering Physics + Math at UC Berkeley.

# What is this page? 
There's a lot I want to learn, and the best way to learn is to teach... or at least to explain!

I plan to compile explanations, computations, expository papers, and other random materials I might produce to aid in my learning process on this site.

Of course, I'm not an expert - if you spot any errors or would just generally like to chit-chat about any topics mentioned, please contact me at

# Note: The site is under costruction.
Please excuse the silly organization, I'll be improving upon it soon (pinky promise).
