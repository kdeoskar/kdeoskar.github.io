# Who am I?
I'm an undergrad studying Engineering Physics + Math major at UC Berkeley.

# What is this page? 
There's much I want to learn, and the best way to learn is to teach... or at least to explain!

I plan to compile explanations, computations, expository papers, and other materials I might produce here to aid in my learning process - and perhaps in yours too! 

Of course, I'm not an expert - if you spot any errors or would just generally like to chit-chat about any topics mentioned, please contact me at
