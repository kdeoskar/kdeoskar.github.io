# Representation Theory of the Lorentz and Poincare Groups

\toc

### Introduction
- Symmetries are ubiquitous in Physics. 
 

- For instance, we know from Classical Mechanics that the symmetries of a system induce conserved quantities or "charges". 


- Similarly, the symmetries of a system put restrictions on the possible hamiltonians that may describe it. So, we can deduce the most general possible form of the hamiltonian in some effective field theory by inspecting its symmetry eg. SU(2) or U(1).


- In the realm of mathematics, symmetries fall under the purview of group theory. Two common ways of studying groups are via their **actions** and **representations**. For instance, the action of $SO(3)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is that of continuous rotation, and its representation on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the set of $3 \times 3$ matrices, $A$, satisying 
$$ A A^T = \mathrm{Id} $$

- The fundamental postulate of Special Relativity is that the speed of light $c$ is the same in all inertial frames. If we consider the set of transformations between inertial frames which respects this assumption, the set turns out to actually be a group, namely, the **Lorentz Group**. 

- The Lorentz Groups consists of rotations and *boosts*. If we also include spatial translations, we obtain the **Poincare Group** (Maggiore, 2010).

- We'll discuss the representation theory of the Lorentz and Poincare groups.
