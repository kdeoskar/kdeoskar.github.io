[Write some important examples of each of the maps]

## Maps of Constant Rank
- Essentially the only property which characterizes a linear maps, if we are allowed to choose separate coordinates for the domain and range, is the *rank* of the map i.e. $\dim \mathrm{Im} (F)$.
- We define the rank of a smooth map $F : M^m \rightarrow N^n$ between manifolds at point $p \in M$ to be the rank of the differential *differential* $dF_p : T_p M \rightarrow T_p N$.
- The rank of a linear map is never higher than the dimensions of its domain and range, so if a map $F : M^m \rightarrow N^n$ has rank equal to $\min\{m,n\}$ at point $p$, we say it has **_full rank at p_**, and if it has full rank at all points in $M$, we say **_F has full rank_**.
